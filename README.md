# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To find the cause of death in each country and the prevalence  of communicable diseases from red zone towards  the neighbouring countries. 

## Process
1. Load the dataset and change the datatypes( I changed Country to geospatail data type) and then I started to look at the data and tried to get more details.
2. Tried to create visualizations to see the insight of the data.

## Results
I choosed Option 2 and the dataset I choose is Causes of Deaths.
The visualization I choose are Bar diagram,Maps,Bubble diagram and Forecasting.
I tried to look very closely some communicable disease like HIV on its hotspots region and their pattern in surrounding couuntries.
I looked onto main factor which is Cardiovascular disease leading to death on large population and found out China and India had common.

(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
It was difficult to visulaize single cause of the death in maps.It would be nice to see the pattern of the HIV/AIDS transmission from South Africa to neighbouring countries and its prevalence in Other continents as well. 

## Future Goals
I would love to look for other diseases and the patterns of change due to certain parameters like temperature and distance.
