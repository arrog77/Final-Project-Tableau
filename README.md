# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To find the cause of death in each country and the prevalence  of communicable diseases from red zone towards  the neighbouring countries. 

## Process
1. Load the dataset and change the datatypes( I changed Country to geospatail data type) and then I started to look at the data and tried to get more details.
2. Tried to create visualizations to see the insight of the data.

## Results
I choosed Option 2 and the dataset I choose is Causes of Deaths.
The visualization I choose are Bar diagram,Maps,Bubble diagram and Forecasting.
I tried to look very closely some communicable disease like HIV on its hotspots region and their pattern in surrounding couuntries.
I looked onto main factor which is Cardiovascular disease leading to death on large population and found out China and India had common.



## Challenges 
It was difficult to visulaize single cause of the death in maps.It would be nice to see the pattern of the HIV/AIDS transmission from South Africa to neighbouring countries and its prevalence in Other continents as well. 

## Future Goals
I would love to look for other diseases and the patterns of change due to certain parameters like temperature and distance.
